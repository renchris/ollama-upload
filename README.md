# HuggingFace Model Download Tools

A comprehensive toolkit for downloading, monitoring, and managing large language models from HuggingFace, with intelligent cleanup procedures to prevent storage waste.

## 🚀 Features

- **Generic monitoring script** with auto-detection for any HuggingFace model
- **Hardware compatibility validation** prevents incompatible downloads
- **Systematic cleanup procedures** to avoid 1TB+ storage waste
- **Rich animated progress tracking** with real-time statistics
- **Ollama integration** with ready-to-use Modelfiles

## 📦 What's Included

- **`monitor_download.sh`** - Enhanced download monitor with auto-detection
- **`HUGGINGFACE_MODEL_DOWNLOAD_GUIDE.md`** - Complete AI assistant reproduction guide  
- **`PROJECT_STATUS.md`** - Session documentation with critical lessons learned

## 🎯 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/ollama-upload.git
cd ollama-upload

# Use for any model download
./monitor_download.sh --help

# Auto-detect everything
./monitor_download.sh

# Specify parameters: files, size_gb, display_name
./monitor_download.sh 17 32 "CodeLlama-13B"
```

## ⚡ Hardware Guidelines

**64GB System (M1 Max):**
- ✅ **Recommended**: 7B-33B models (CodeLlama-13B, Qwen2.5-Coder-14B)
- ❌ **Avoid**: >35B parameters, >50GB downloads
- 🧮 **Rule**: Model size × 2 = minimum RAM needed

## 🛡️ Prevents Storage Waste

This toolkit emerged from cleaning up **1.018TB of unusable model artifacts**:
- 896GB Qwen3-Coder-480B (incompatible with hardware)
- 122GB Qwen3-32B (unused, missed in initial cleanup)

**Systematic cleanup detection** prevents future oversights.

## 📋 Requirements

- Git LFS installed
- macOS/Linux/WSL
- Basic understanding of model hardware requirements

## 🤝 Use Case

Perfect for developers who:
- Download multiple LLMs for local development
- Need reliable progress monitoring for large downloads
- Want to avoid storage waste from incompatible models
- Integrate models with Ollama for development tools (Zed, VS Code, etc.)
