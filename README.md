# HuggingFace to Ollama Model Pipeline

A streamlined toolkit for downloading HuggingFace models and integrating them with Ollama for local AI development.

## 🚀 Core Workflow

**HuggingFace** → **Local Download** → **Ollama Integration** → **Ready for Development**

## ✨ Features

- **Smart download monitoring** with auto-detection for any HuggingFace model
- **Hardware compatibility validation** prevents incompatible downloads
- **Animated progress tracking** with real-time statistics
- **One-command Ollama integration** with ready-to-use Modelfiles
- **Storage management** to keep your system clean

## 📦 What's Included

- **`monitor_download.sh`** - Enhanced download monitor with auto-detection
- **`HUGGINGFACE_MODEL_DOWNLOAD_GUIDE.md`** - Complete download and integration guide  
- **`PROJECT_STATUS.md`** - Documentation and lessons learned

## 🎯 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/ollama-upload.git
cd ollama-upload

# Download any HuggingFace model with monitoring
./monitor_download.sh --help

# Auto-detect and monitor (run in model directory)
./monitor_download.sh

# Specify parameters: files, size_gb, display_name
./monitor_download.sh 17 32 "CodeLlama-13B"
```

## ⚡ Hardware Guidelines

**64GB System (M1 Max):**
- ✅ **Recommended**: 7B-33B models (CodeLlama-13B, Qwen2.5-Coder-14B)
- ❌ **Avoid**: >35B parameters, >50GB downloads
- 🧮 **Rule**: Model size × 2 = minimum RAM needed

## 🔄 Complete Workflow

1. **Choose Model**: Browse HuggingFace for compatible models
2. **Download**: Use `git lfs clone` with our monitoring script
3. **Integrate**: Create Ollama model with provided Modelfile template
4. **Develop**: Use in your favorite AI-enabled editor (Zed, VS Code, etc.)

## 📋 Requirements

- Git LFS installed
- macOS/Linux/WSL
- Ollama installed
- Understanding of model hardware requirements

## 🤝 Perfect For

Developers who want to:
- Download and test multiple LLMs locally
- Integrate models with Ollama for development tools
- Monitor large downloads with reliable progress tracking
- Maintain clean storage with hardware-appropriate models
